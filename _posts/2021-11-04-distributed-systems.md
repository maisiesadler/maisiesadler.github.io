Modern systems are increasingly complex and distributed.
Every engineer must understand the trade-offs of every decision and keep observability and resilience in mind.

This article outlines some patterns and practices for adding resilience to complex, distributed systems.

First a few definitions,

- **Resilience** - The ability to maintain acceptable service levels during a system failure
- **Complex Systems** - A system with enough parts that an individual cannot hold the model in their head, the outputs can be unpredictable
- **Distributed Systems** - A system is with multiple components spread over multiple hosts

Understanding the requirements of the system is important as it will help to guide our decisions for which behaviours are essential and which can be compromised.

The [fallacies of distributed systems](http://wiki.c2.com/?EightFallaciesOfDistributedComputing) tell us that we cannot rely on the network to be reliable or secure. We must decide for each operation when we encounter a failure; wait, retry or cancel?

## Observability

Observability is key to be able to navigate operations through a complex, distributed system. It gives us operational visibility and helps us understand system bottlenecks.

We can define the expected behaviour of our system under normal conditions, for example, "We expect 99% availability while processing 200 orders per second".

When we make changes to the system we can monitor metrics such as latency and error rate to ensure we're not unintentionally degrading the user experience.

## Design patterns

So what patterns can we use to add resilience into our system?

### Scaling

Adding more resources to be able to handle more requests.
This can be _horizontal_ by adding more similar resources, or _vertical_ by increasing the size of existing resources.

Must be cautious of overwhelming downstream resources.

### Caching

Increase availability and resilience by [caching](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/) data that is likely to be accessed. Either after the first time it is read, or by precalculating results when data is updated.
If many queries now access the cache instead of getting the latest data this can greatly reduce load on the rest of the system.

The trade-off here is that the user will not always see the latest data.

### Events and Queues

[Event-driven architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html) is a loosely coupled approach that can increase system resilience by allowing an operation to resume after a component has failed.

Events can be captured on queues so the consuming component can process messages at a steady rate.
This rate can be increased by scaling the component, ensuring the rate isn't so high we start overwhelming downstream resources such as databases.

This pattern introduces some complications to be aware of
- **Duplicates** - If the operation is not [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) we must add a request identifier and de-duplicate
- **Ordering** - Out of order messages can apply updates incorrectly, this can potentially be dealt with using timestamps or versions

### Isolation

Critical operations can be isolated into separate components and their resources can be isolated, this prevents them from being affected by failure in other parts of the system.

Isolation also allows teams to independently maintain different system capabilities.

### Degrading functionality

Can we turn off parts of the system to protect other parts?

A bulkhead is a pattern that does exactly that, the system is designed such that isolated functionality can be switched of in the event of failure.

This could be a manual process with feature toggle. Or automated with circuit breakers.

Circuit breakers switch off functionality on given error conditions and intermittently let traffic through to test if service can be resumed.
This protects downstream resources and also allows the application to continue processing other potentially successful operations.

#### Timeouts and Retries

If a call is taking too long in a distributed system, it could be because there is a transient fault and sometimes it is better to cancel the call and retry.
"Too long" could be different for each operation and we can use our observability tools to guide us here.

Be aware of
- **Duplicates** - In case the operation failed after it was received, we can only retry if there will be no side effects
- **Retry Storm** - Too many retries can end up doing more harm than good

## Testing system resilience

It is good to understand how much failure a system can tolerate and still operate within acceptable boundaries.

### Chaos Engineering

[Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) is the practice of running experiments on a system to observe how it reacts.

This can reduce on-call burden not only by giving higher confidence in the system but can serve as on-call training. Engineers become familiar with the observability tools and are engaged and focused on resilience.

- Start with one-off experiments or game days
- Choose experiments based on real-world events and incidents
- Once confident, run the experiment in production
- Have a rollback plan in place and revert once you have learned something

## System design and team structure

[Conway's law](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/demystifying-conways-law) tells us that that the structure of the system will reflect the organization that built it. It follows that loosely coupled systems are created by loosely coupled teams.

Though loosely coupled, teams should be highly aligned. Visibility between teams helps to form shared values, principles, and practices.

## Conclusion

Distributed systems are part of life working on modern software and it's important we understand the compromises we make with each decision - whether it's added complexity and maintenance, degraded experience or just more expensive there will always be a cost to added resilience.
