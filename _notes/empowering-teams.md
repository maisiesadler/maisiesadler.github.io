#### Model 1
- Teams exist to serve business
- IT mindset, feature factory

#### Model 2
- Come up with solutions customers love that work for the business
- Product mindset

In first model, product managers are just project managers.
- Using model 2 because of a lack of trust

Leaders vs managers
- Leadership serves to inspire people to greater accomplishments, and management exists to motivate them to the objective.
  - Mike Fisher (CTO Etsy)

### Leaders

Empowered teams require business context
- Product Vision
  - Good product people want to contribute to something meaningful
- Product Strategy
  - Entire company shouldn't solve all problems at once
  - Make decisions of which problems to solve in what order
- Product Principles
- Product Priorities
  - Focus on outcomes rather than output
  - OKR system
- Product Evangelism
  - Sell business on decision

- Curiosity, respect and kindness combined with crazy work ethic will take you anywhere you want to go
  - Staci Santi

### Management
- Hiring
- Coaching - get to next level
- Create objectives

- Communicate, value relationships and build the community
  - Christian Idiodi

- Instead of hiring smart people to tell them what to do, let them tell you what to do
  - Steve Jobs

### Trust

- Trust is formed by Competence and Character.
  - Competence = capabilities, skills, track record
  - Character =  integrity, motive, intent
  - Stephen Covey
- Can't find good people, end up looking over someone who is a jerk = not trustworthy
- Hire on potential if hiring manager is capable of hiring to competence

"No Assholes Rule"

- Interview questions to get people to think like you
  - (bad thing)
- Filter for competence, then filter assholes - rest are great candidates

### Conclusion

Ordinary people can do great things if they are empowered to do so

Empowered teams
- Staffed with competent people with character, cevering range of skills
  - Product, Tech, Design
- Team is assigned problems to solve, able to decide best way to solve them
